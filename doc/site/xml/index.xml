	  <em>codeare</em>, <strong>co</strong>mmon <strong>d</strong>ata 
	  <strong>e</strong>xchange <strong>a</strong>nd

	  is an open-source, comprehensive high performance package
	  for testing, staging and production of MRI image
	  reconstruction and sequence runtime interaction. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  It was designed and built to simplify the deployment of
	  original ideas into the production on MRI scanners, offer
	  unlimited expansion by allowing the easy integration of code
	  written in many programming languages,
	  like <em>Python</em>, <em>Java</em>, <em>Perl</em>, ... and 
	  meta languages like <em>MATLAB</em>, <em>octave</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The core is built around a C++ matrix template that meets
	  the requirements of MRI data processing. It includes a
	  RAM/HD runtime database very much comparable to what we know
	  as workspace in software like MATLAB, octave, numpy/scipy
	  etc. 
	  A comprehensive and extansible toolbox has been programmed
	  for operations on the matrix objects like ...
